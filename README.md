Includes:
1. Data Analysis
    * Statistical Data Analysis (memory optimized and brute force versions) and Texture Analysis
2. Utility class(es) for plotting and preprocessing
3. Wrapped keras model class for additional setup requirements
4. folder containing generated models and plots
5. generated requirements.txt, freezed pip packages for easy venv setup
6. thesis PDF
